# Naming

## Convention

Our naming convention comes from the approach we already use in our code:

- `ourFunctions` are defined in JavaScript with camelCase by standard
- React components are in `PascalCaseComponent`
- all other entities should be by standard in `kebab-case`

## Examples

- domain: `[kebab-case]`
- component directory: `[PascalCase]`
- any other directory: `[kebab-case]`
- component file: `PascalCase.type.ext`
- asset: `kebab-case.ext`
- util/hook: `camelCase.ext`
