# API Communication

## HTTP Client

**Axios**

Axios provides a clean, promise-based API for making HTTP requests. It includes built-in
request/response interceptors, automatic JSON transformation, and better error handling compared to the native fetch API.

## Data Validation

**Zod**

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema validation library. It allows us to validate API responses at runtime, ensuring type safety and catching data inconsistencies early. Zod schemas can also be used to generate TypeScript types automatically.
