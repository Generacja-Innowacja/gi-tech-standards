## Design System Documentation

**Storybook**

Storybook allows us to develop and document UI components in isolation. It serves as a living style guide and helps ensure
component consistency across the application. This is especially valuable in projects with multiple developers.

## Routing

**React Router >= 7.9 (Framework Mode)**

React Router 7 introduces framework mode, which provides a more integrated routing experience
similar to Next.js or Remix. This mode offers better data loading, error handling, and overall
developer experience while maintaining the flexibility of React Router.

through intelligent purging.
