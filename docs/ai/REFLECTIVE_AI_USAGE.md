# Reflective AI usage

Reflective use of AI primarily means engaging with artificial intelligence tools consciously, critically, and
purposefully. It also involves approaching AI as a partner in daily work that requires analysis and reasoning. It is not
about uncritically accepting AI outputs without considering the meaning and coherence of the generated content.
Reflective use therefore includes testing, analyzing, and evaluating whether the result genuinely addresses the problem
at hand. The human remains in control of the task, while AI provides support — never the other way around.

We’re entering an era where access to technology, knowledge, and tools offers more people than ever before the
opportunity to grow — regardless of where they live, their income, or education level. Our mission is to democratize
access to programming, entrepreneurship, and digital skills. Today, we can achieve things that would have seemed
impossible just a decade ago — thanks to AI.

## Reflective use of AI becomes the new standard

Some of you are already using AI in your daily work — as a partner in thought processes, a tool for research, or as
support for writing, coding, and even mentoring. That’s excellent, but it is only the beginning. Even those who
regularly work with AI often feel they have only scratched the surface of what is possible.

We are seeing that individuals who are already able to use AI with reflection and sensitivity are completing tasks that
were previously out of reach — faster, more effectively, and with greater impact. We see interns, even with limited
experience, entering complex environments and rapidly delivering value with AI’s assistance. AI is not replacing people;
it is empowering them.

## What this means for us

- **Using AI is our new reality** — we can no longer ignore it. It is not a passing trend but a universal tool for work.
If you are not learning how to use it, you risk falling behind. Want to be part of the change? Start experimenting.
- **Every project, every initiative, should start with AI** — AI should be present from the earliest stages of
prototyping and planning. This allows us to learn, create, and grow faster, meaning we can accomplish more for our
community.
- **The use of AI will be part of our expectations** — which is why we will ask: How are you using AI? What have you
learned? What works, and what doesn’t? Through these conversations, we can grow together: these skills will give us a
generational advantage in the sector.

- **Learn independently — but share what you discover** — We have access to incredible tools: chatbots, coding
assistants, AI agents. But we learn the most from each other. Don’t keep this knowledge to yourself. Share it — it’s our
collective capital.

Today, as Generacja Innowacja, we have everything we need to be at the forefront of Poland’s non-governmental tech
sector. We know how to build complex IT solutions, and the results of our work speak for themselves. We maintain
products used by 4.5 million people. Like any nonprofit organization, we are short on only one thing: time. AI gives us
the opportunity to reclaim that time and focus on what matters most — not just technology, but above all, people.

## Security and Ethics

In a world where AI can generate text, code, and ideas in a matter of seconds, it is our responsibility to ensure both
digital and ethical security. When using AI, we must remain especially vigilant in several key areas:

**Data:** Never share sensitive, personal, or confidential data with AI tools — especially if the data is not yours or
if you do not have explicit permission to share it.

**Content verification:** AI can make mistakes. Always verify AI-generated content, particularly when it is intended for
external communication or publication within our community.

**Ethics:** Remember that AI may unintentionally replicate stereotypes or biases. Use these tools thoughtfully, and
always ask yourself: Is what I am creating serving people in a responsible way?

**Reporting concerns:** If you notice anything concerning or have doubts about the behavior of an AI tool, report it via
our dedicated channel (_#ai-talks_). We are building a culture where security is a shared responsibility.

AI is a powerful tool — but we are fully responsible for how we use it. The trust we build as a foundation is based on
transparency, careful consideration, and accountability. We cannot take that lightly.

## Our Vision

AI is transforming everything — our work, our way of thinking, education, programming, and communities. We are not
merely observers of this change. We are not falling behind. We are part of it.

As a technology-driven, pro bono organization, we have a duty to ask ourselves:

**How can we support young people, mentors, teachers, developers, and activists — so that AI becomes their ally,not
a barrier?**

**How can we develop the Foundation to continuously automate processes, saving valuable time for our volunteers?**

I believe that together, we will find the answers — through action, curiosity, and the courage to keep experimenting
with the possibilities of AI.
