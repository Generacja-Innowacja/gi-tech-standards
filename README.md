# gi-tech-standards

This is repository contains all documents regarding technical standards developed by **Generacja Innowacja** tech team.
The purpose of these documents is to establish clear, modular technology standards for all projects developed and
maintained by our organization. By splitting each section into its own file, we create a more organized, maintainable,
and navigable set of guidelines.

Document also will try to provide deeper context for each decision made during the development.
