# Projects

This document aims to describe the rules for working with GitHub Projects as a tool for task management.

When starting a task:

* Make sure the task is visible on the [All products](https://github.com/orgs/Generacja-Innowacja/projects/17/views/1) board.
* Move the task to the “In progress” column.
* Assign yourself in the Assignee field.
* If you plan to collaborate with someone, please leave a comment under the relevant task and mention your co-authors.
* Interns only: ensure that the internship coordinators are aware of any jointly executed tasks.

When opening a pull request:

* Add yourself to the Assignee field.
* In the Development section, link the appropriate task (issue).
* Do not use Labels, Projects, or Milestone.
* Get familiar with the [Code review](../process/development/CODE_REVIEW.md) process.

When closing (merging) a pull request:

* Verify whether the related task should be closed and ensure it has been closed. If needed, adjust its status.

Additionally, the following actions are prohibited:

* archiving tasks (issues),
* closing tasks without completing them,
* moving changes to subsequent pull requests without leaving information in the pre-existing pull request.
