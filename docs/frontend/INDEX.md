# Front-end Standards

This document outlines the core technologies, tools, and libraries used in our front-end projects. Each choice has been made with careful consideration of maintainability, developer experience, and long-term sustainability.

> **All new front-end projects in the organization should follow these configuration standards.**
>
> These standards ensure consistency across projects, making it easier for developers to switch between projects and maintain code quality. If you need to use a different technology, please seek approval from the Technical Leader first.
