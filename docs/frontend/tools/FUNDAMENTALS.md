# Fundamentals

## Runtime Environment

**Node.js >= 24**

We use the latest LTS version of Node.js to ensure access to modern JavaScript features and performance improvements. Node.js 24 provides excellent support for ES modules, improved performance, and better security.

## Package Management

**Yarn >= 1.22**

Yarn provides reliable dependency management with lockfile consistency, better performance than npm, and excellent workspace support for monorepos. We use Yarn for its stability and proven track record.

## Language

**TypeScript >= 5.9**

TypeScript brings type safety to JavaScript, catching errors at compile-time rather than runtime. This significantly reduces bugs and improves developer experience with better IDE support and autocomplete.
