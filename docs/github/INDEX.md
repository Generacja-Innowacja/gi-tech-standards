# Git & Github

*These guidelines ensure a consistent, maintainable, and robust backend codebase across all services developed under

Hello dear volunteer, it's so nice to have you! To help us keep technical standards, please read steps below before

## What is git and what is Github? 

Git is a control system, that is, a program monitoring simultaneous changes in the codebase. This type of solution is
an indispensable part of a programmer's work — the larger the project, the more developers involved, the more
complicated independent work can become. It is easy to imagine a situation where two people make changes within the
same file. Here, Git is on guard to ensure that the changes do not conflict.
Git, of course, has its alternatives, such as CVS, but in our foundation, we use only Git.

GitHub is one of the services that offer Git. Note: they are not the same. Git is an independent system, whereas
GitHub is a portal that allows us to host files and manage them with Git. In addition to GitHub, there is also e.g.
GitLab, which is another Git service.
