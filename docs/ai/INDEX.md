# AI usage standards

In **_Generacja Innowacja_** we came up with new standard we expect from our interns and volunteers. We call it:
**Reflective use of AI**.

> Reflective use of AI means using artificial intelligence tools consciously, critically, and intentionally — not
> blindly copying outputs, but treating AI as a thinking partner. It involves testing, analyzing, learning, and
> evaluating whether the result truly addresses the problem. The human leads, AI supports — never the other way around.
